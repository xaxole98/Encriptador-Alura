# Message Encryptor

This project is a simple message encrypter and decryptor. It converts vowels into a series of codes and vice versa, thus providing a basic way to hide messages.

## Use

The encryptor is an interactive web page that runs in a browser. Allows the user to write a message in lowercase and without accents, then encrypt or decrypt it. The result is displayed on the screen and can be copied to the clipboard.

### Requirements

To run the encryptor, you will need:

- A modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files as a ZIP file.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Write a message in the text field.

4. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message or the "Decrypt" button to decrypt it.

5. The result will be displayed on the screen. If you want to copy the encrypted or decrypted message, click the "Copy" button.

6. Done! Now you can share the encrypted or decrypted message as you wish.

## Personalization

If you want to customize the code or add new functionality, here are some areas you can explore:

- Modify the encryption character set to fit your needs.
- Improve the user interface with additional CSS styles.
- Add input validations to ensure that the user enters a valid message.
